Please provide a description and an example for each of the following terms:

	- URI? and what is the component of URI

URI--
A Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) is a compact sequence of characters that identifies an abstract or physical resource.

URI Components--
foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
         \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
          |           |            |            |        |
       scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
          |   _____________________|__
         / \ /                        \
         urn:example:animal:ferret:nose


	- URI Reference
URI-reference is used to denote the most common usage of a resource identifier.
URI / relative-ref
relative-ref  = relative-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]
relative-part = "//" authority path-abempty
                 / path-absolute
                 / path-noscheme
                 / path-empty

	- Absolute URI
The absolute form of a URI without a fragment identifier.
Absolute-URI  = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ]
hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                  / path-absolute
                  / path-rootless
                  / path-empty

	- Absolute Path
A relative reference that begins with a single slash character.
Path-absolute = "/" [ segment-nz *( "/" segment ) ]

	- Empty path
path-empty    = 0<pchar>
If the base URI has a defined authority component and an empty path, then return a string consisting of "/" concatenated with the reference's path

	- Base URI
A base URI must be established by the parser prior to parsing URI references that might be relative.  A base URI must conform to the <absolute-URI> syntax rule

Give a base URI 'http://tgp.com/trainings/courses?name=en' and the below relative references, could you please provide what will be the result of merging the base uri wih each one of these realtive references

	  "./math"        
      	  "math/"          
      	  "/math"           
          "//tgp-math"          
      	  "?name=math"         
      	  "subject?math"     
 	  "."             
          "./"           
          ".."          
          "../"          
          "../rooms"     
	  "../../../../topic"
